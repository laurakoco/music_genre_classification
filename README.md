# Music Genre Classification in Python

Analyze and classify audio signals in Python

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore different machine learning classifiers for classifying music genre from an audio sample. 

## Built With

* Python 3.7
* [Librosa](https://librosa.org/librosa/) 0.7.2
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 0.0
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 2.1.1
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 1.0.4

## Data

[GTZAN](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html) Genre Collection

* Dataset consists of 1000 audio tracks, 30 seconds long each
* Tracks are all 22050 Hz mono 16-bit audio files in .wav format
* 10 genres (100 songs/genre)
	* Blues
	* Classical
	* Country
	* Disco
	* Hip Hop
	* Jazz
	* Metal
	* Pop
	* Raggae
	* Rock

### Pre-Processing: Feature Extraction

In order to train and test our classifiers, we need to identify the features to extract from the audio samples. Luckily, prior research has already identified features that perform well in music genre classification.

The features that we extract are:

* Zero Crossing Rate - rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or negative to positive
* Spectral Centroid - weighted mean of frequencies present in audio clip
* Spectral Roll-Off - the frequency below which a specified percentage of the total spectral energy ( 85% by default) lies
* Chroma Frequencies - the intensity of each of the 12 distinct musical chroma of the octave; chroma representation/chromagarm (via short-term fourier transform) 
* Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) (x20) - coefficients that collectively make up an MFC
* Mel-Frequency Cepstrum (MFC) - representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound, based on a linear cosine transform of a log power spectrum on a nonlinear mel scale of frequency

This results in a feature vector of 25 features.

The feature extraction is done by running preprocessing_pandas.py. This file takes several minutes to run, as the processing of each sample takes a few seconds.

### Results

We use the pre-processed features in order to train and test the different machine learning classifiers:
* Linear SVM
* Polynomial SVM
* RBF SVM
* k-NN
* Logistic Regression
* Na√Øve Bayesian
* LDA
* QDA
* Random Forest
* Decision Tree
* Neural Network

Please note, some of these classifiers required hyper-parameter tuning to optimize the accuracy (SVM, k-NN, random forest, neural network)

## Usage

* Download GTZAN dataset
* Run requirements.txt
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Run preprocessing.py to generate csv file (data.csv) with features for each file
	* Change path to the root directory (genres) of GTZAN dataset
```
path = '/path/to/gtzan/genres/' # path to data
```
* Run classical_models.py to compare the different models
